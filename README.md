# Nolocal-Derivative

'Teapezoidal_quadrature__formula' and 'Simpson' are methods to calculate the approxiamtion of integration; (I use it in next code)

The 'Approximation_Deriviative' uses nonlocal derivative methods to approximate the derivative; (Using Teapezoidal quadrature formula to calculte the integration)

The 'solve100' is how to solve differential equations by solve nonlocal equaions with initial conditions.
